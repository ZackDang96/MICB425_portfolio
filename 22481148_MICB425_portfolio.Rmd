#Module 1

## Evidence Worksheet_01 for "Prokaryotes: The Unseen Majority"

### Learning Objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

### General Questions
#### What were the main questions being asked?

This article asks and attempts to answer the following questions:

1. What is the total number of prokaryotic cells in the 3 main habitats and the cumulative total on the planet?

2. What is the total amount of carbon contained in prokaryotic cells in the 3 main habitats and the global total?

3. What is the average turnover rate and productivity of prokaryotes in the 3 main habitats and the global total?

#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

Cell density data from samples ofthe 3 main representative habitats (Aquatic, soil and subsurface environments) were analyzed and total number estimations were generated. Aquatic numbers were estimated from mean sample values of several primary studies. Soil numbers were estimated based on cultivated soil sample numbers.Subsurface numbers were extrapolated from various studies' sample data, but also estimated from calculating average porosity of terrestrial subsurface environments and average subsurface prokaryotic volume, and also from groundwater sample data. Carbon content was estimated in soil and subsurface environments as half the dry weight of the average prokaryotic cell. In aquatic environments, the upper estimate of carbon per cell is used. 

#### Summarize the main results or findings. 

The total number of prokaryotes on Earth is estimated to be 4-6x10^30 cells and the total amount of prokarotic carbon is esitmated to be 350-550 Pg, which is 60-100% of the total carbon in plants. Prokaryotes also cumulativey contain 10 times the amount of phosphorous and nitrogen than plants. Heterotropic prokaryote turnover is fastest in the upper 200m of the ocean and slowest in subsurface environments. The estimated global cellular production rate is 1.7x10^30 cells/yr. This also leads to a large capacity for genetic diversification through mutation.

#### Do new questions arise from the results?

1. How can subsurface estimation methods be refined to more accurately characterize the subsurface prokaryotic world?

2. How can phylogenetic analysis methods be changed to account for the high degree of diversity and mutation rate in prokaryotes?

3. With the differences in prokaryotic genomes and evolution through mutation, how do we definte a prokaryotic species?

#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

Overall, the paper did a decent job of combining sample data from multiple papers and generating population estimates of the 3 major habitats and representing this data in easy-to-read tables. However, much of this data is based on estimation, with the extrapolation of subsurface numbers having a high degree of error. Some assumptions made include the use of an average prokaryotic cell volume and an average carbon content per cell value, on which global total estimates are made. Despite this, the evidence is adequate given our current models and techniques and thus the conclusions are valid. The paper rightfully acknowledges the limitations of some methods and discrepancies between studies. With the development of sampling methods and improved metagenomic analytical techniques, more accurate estimations can be made in the future. 

## Evidence Worksheet_02 Life and the Evolution of Earth's Atmosphere

### Learning objectives: 
Comment on the emergence of microbial life and the evolution of Earth systems
    
#### Indicate the key events in the evolution of Earth systems at each approximate moment in the time series. If times need to be adjusted or added to the timeline to fully account for the development of Earth systems, please do so. 

    + 4.6 billion years ago - Formation of the Solar System from a local accretion disk, creating the Sun and the planets.
    
    + 4.2 billion years ago - Formation of the oceans, creating the land-sea surface we know today. There is some evidence that plate tectonics started at this time, as well as the first amino acids and RNA.
    
    + 3.8 billion years ago - Earliest evidence of life in the form of cells.
    
    + 3.75 billion years ago - A group splits off from the last common ancestor and forms the domain, Archaea.
    
    + 3.5 billion years ago - Evolution of the domain, Prokaryotes and evolution of photosynthesis. There is fossil evidence for the formation of microbial aggregations and biofilms. 
    
    + 3.0 billion years ago - First evidence for the presence of viruses
    
    + 2.7 billion years ago - Evolution of cyanobacteria
    
    + 2.2 billion years ago - The Great Oxygenation Event, brought upon by massed photosynthesis by cyanobacteria. 
    
    + 2.1 billion years ago - Evolution of Eukarya and later (2.0 Gya), evidence of endosymbiosis by Eukarya to form chloroplasts and mitochondria
    
    + 1.3 billion years ago - Lineages that eventually formed plant, animal and fungal kingdoms split off from the main eukaryote ancestral line
    
    + 550,000 years ago - First land plants evolved
    
    + 200,000 years ago - Evolution of mammals


#### Describe the dominant physical and chemical characteristics of Earth systems at the following waypoints:  

    + Hadean - The early Hadean might have been characterized by global glaciation due to a weak, young Sun. Later, a very hot atmosphere comprised mainly of water vapour and CO2 formed, with a silica crust on the surface
    
    + Archean - About 3 times hotter than the current Earth, with a liquid water acidic ocean and a mostly CO2 atmosphere
    
    + Precambrian - The evolution of photosynthesis and the massed expansion of cyanobacteria caused a huge increase in atmospheric oxygen, called the Great Oxygenation Event
    
    + Proterozoic  - Oxygen rich, hot atmosphere
    
    + Phanerozoic  - Exolution of land plants contributes to a further increase in atmospheric oxygen levels. The Earth is also slightly cooler. 

## Evidence Worksheet_03 "The Anthropocene"

### Learning Objectives
Evaluate human impacts on the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

### General Questions
#### What were the main questions being asked?

1. What parameters can be used to define particular aspects of the Earth that are at risk from anthropogenic effects?

2. Have humans created imbalances in the modern nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, and how would this affect the cycles of the future?

3. How will the engineered Anthropocene affect global biodiversity and the climate?

#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

Rockstrom established a framework of planetary boundaries to distinguish aspects of the Holocene that are at risk, focusing primarily on climate change, rate of biodiversity loss and the nitrogen cycle. Climate, biodiversity and atmospheric data from literature sources are taken and analyzed.

#### Summarize the main results or findings. 

9 planetary boundaries were defined: climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle, phosphorous cycle, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, global feshwater usage, change in land use, atmospheric aerosol loading and chemical polution. The first of these 3 boundaries have already exceeded the safe limits, with phosphorous cycle and ocean acidification approaching this limit. Recently, there has been evidence for a shift in the Earth's climate away form the Holocene state. The current rate of biodiversity is unsustainable and if not reduced would lead to irreversible ecosystem erosion. Excess nitrogen and phosphorous inflow to oceans is causing dangerous levels of acidification and anoxia

#### Do new questions arise from the results?

What is the extent to which the Earth can sustain the effect of humans without compromising its climate, biodiversity and ecosystems?

How can we quantify these planetary boundaries?

How long does it take to cause irreversible damage to Earth's natural systems and how low will it take following remediation for these systems to recover?

#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

The authors made good use of literature values and specific data to illustrate their main points and to support their conclusions. They did acknowledge that much of their planetary boundaries model is based on assumptions and has a high level of uncertainty, especially in terms of hard numerical boundaries and temporal considerations. They stress that there are still huge gaps in the understanding of Earth's systems and how they interact with each other and with humans.

## Problem set_01

### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific Questions:

#### What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

The 3 main primary prokaryotic habitats are aquatic, soil and subsurface habitats, each with their own sub-habitats. Aquatic environments encompass a huge range of habitats, varying from freshwater oxic to saltwater anoxic and with great variation in chemical composition. Marine environments contain about 1.181x10^29 prokaryotes. Soil environments are a major reservoir for organic carbon and other elements and the microbes that inhabit these environments contribute significantly to global food webs and contain about 2.556x10^29 prokaryotic cells. Subsurface environments include both terrestrial and marine sediments below a certain depth. Much of the prokaryotic density is extrapolated off estimations but comes to a large number of 3.8x10^30 cells.

#### What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

The total number of cells in the upper 200m of the ocean is 3.6x10^28, where 2.9x10^27 of these cells are autotrophic cyanobacteria including the genus prochlorococcus. Of the total cell density at this depth range, this represents approximately 8%. This suggests that a large proportion of carbon fixation occurs in the ocean and that oceanic autotrophs are influential to the Earth's carbon cycle and that these prokaryotes are also a significant reservoir of organic carbon.

#### What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  

Autotroph - Able to use light energy to fix atmospheric and dissolved CO2 into organic carbon for biological use

Heterotroph - Use organic carbon as their source of metabolic energy

Lithotroph - Make use of inorganic substrates to obtain reducing equivalents

#### Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

The deepest possible habiat that could support prokaryotic life in terrestrial subsurface sedimnts is rougly 4000m. In marine subsurface sediments, the maximum depth is unlikely below that of the Mariana Trench, which is ~10900m deep. This is because at these depths, the temperature is too high to maintain DNA and proteins without denaturing them. 

#### Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  

The highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is the mesosphere, up to 48km in altitude. The primary limiting factor is the lack of organic material and reducing equivalents, making adequate acquisition of nutrients for metabolism very difficult.

#### Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth's biosphere measured in km?  

The absolute limit of the biosphere is 77km, where the mesophere ends. Microscopic fungi, their spores spores and some prokaryotic cells have been observed at altitudes close to this value.

#### How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)

Annual production is calculated by multiplying population by turnovers per year

Example calculation for number of turnovers in cells per year in marine heterotrophs above 200m:
```{r}
((3.6*10^28)*365)/16
```  

#### What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

This relationship is largely dependent on the ability of light to penetrate the ocean depths. At depths below 200m, light struggles to penetrate, decreasing autotrophic productivity. In terrestrial habitats, there is severely limited light below the surface thus the low primary productivity and carbon assimilation and turnover rate.

Carbon efficiency of marine heterotrophs in the top 200m of the ocean: 20% 5-20fg C/cell 10x10^-30 pg/Cell (3.6x10^28 Cells)x(10x10^-30 pg/cell)= 0.72 Pg of carbon

4x0.72 = 2.88 Pg/yr of carbon and 51 Pg C/yr with 85% of carbon being consumed = 43 Pg C/yr (43 Pg C/yr)/(2.88 Pg/yr) = 14.9, 1 turnover every 24.5 days

#### How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10-7 per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

Simultaneous mutations per generation = 4x10^-7 mutations/generation)^4 = 2.56x10^26

3.6x10^28 cells and 365/16=22.8 turnovers/yr. (3.6x10^28 x 22.8 = 8.2x10^29 Cells/yr x 2.56x10^-26 mutations/generation) = 2.1x10^4 mutations/yr.

#### Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  

The high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells combined with large populations allows prokaryotes to exhibit a high level of genetic diveristy and combined with horizontal gene transfer, leads to exceptional adaptability to changing environmental condtions. This means that in situations of high nutritional and/or environmental selective pressures, small sub-populations will accumulate sufficient mutations and genes to survive and procreate. 

#### What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text? 

With the huge degree of prokaryotic abundance and genetic diversity, the metabolic potential of the collective microbial biosphere is enormous. Also, given the high mutational rate, it is likely that the emergence of any new natural or manmade chemical compounds will quickly become metabolic substrates for certain prokaryotes, creating new ecological niches.

## Problem set_02 Microbial Engines
### Learning objectives: 
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles.

#### Specific Questions:

#### What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?  

Geophysical processes such as the erosion and weathering of rocks, volcanism and plat tectonics helped create and sustain key elemental cycles such as mineral ions and metals, while biogeochemical processes mediated by microorganisms such as the nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon cycles support the aforementioned geophysical processes. Abiotic processes are often very slow and can take thousands of years to complete some cycles, involving low energy changes, while biotic processes can be relatively rapid and involve frequent energy transformations. Abiotic processes supply a continuous stream of elements to the food chain and biotic processes return these elements to the Earth to be recycled. 

#### Why is Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?
  
Due to the production line-esque nature of most biogeochemical cycles, with different groups of organisms being responsible for specific steps in each cycle, as well as the accompanying abiotic geophysical processes, the redox state of the Earth arises as an emergent property. The collective function of all these processes allows for a continuous cycle of reduction and oxidation. If these processes occured independently, this would not be achieved due to a massive degree of energy inefficiency and redundancy.

#### How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?  

Depending on the environmental conditions, the laws of thermodynamics can favour electron transfer between different substrates in the forwar or reverse directions. The presence of specific compounds can directly influence the most thermodynamically favourale direciton of electron transfer. For example, in reducing environments containing H2S or CO, oxidation is unlikely to occur. This results in the creation of unique ecological niches ranging from the massive oxic upper 200m of the ocean to the microscopic anoxic soil crumb interior. Microbes overcome thermodynamic barriers by possessing enzymes and catalysts that drastically reduce these energy barriers to reverse electron flow in specific conditions allowing for greater metabolic flexibility.

#### Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox niches and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change? 

The metabolic genes involved in the nitrogen cycle are widespread and heavily transferred through HGT. Over time, certain microbial groups have become specialized in their particular role, for example: Rhizobacterium in nitrogen fixation and Planctomycetes in anammox reactions. These specializations evoled to reduce genetic redundancy and energy wastage within ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle has profound effects on climate change. N2O is a powerful greenhouse gas and its release or redution into N2 is directly controlled by a niche group of denitrifying bacteria. Disruptions to this process or to the microbes responsible would lead to a higher rate of global warming and climate change. 

#### What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?  

Much of the microbial diversity arises due to changes in metabolic diversity due to environmental and nutritional selective pressures. Through environmental sampling and phylogenetic analysis, researchers can identify new protein families based on evolutionary lineages and tracking spontaneous mutations and HGT events. Unique environments provide a wealth of genetic information on describing novel metabolic enzymes and pathways.

#### On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?  

With the sheer abundance, environmental resilience and metabolic adaptability of microorganisms, they are able to safeguard the essential genes required for life and the maintenance of a functional redox state. The authors recognize the persistence of microbes over millenia and the presence of both widespread metabolic gene clusters as well as unique specialized processes encoded in their DNA. In the case of apocalypse, some microbes will survive and maintain the genetic information required to sustain life.

##Writing Assignment 1

###Spaceship Earth, A Human-Driven, Microbe-Powered Vessel

####Introduction

Just how dependent is the human race on the global microbiome for our survival and how well can these microbes fare in the absence of humans? In this paper, I will address the statement: "Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformations it provides." and present arguments as to why I agree with this statement and provide evidence in which to support my case. It is important to delineate the purpose behind this assessment and the implications of the decision to support or refute this statement. Since the birth of humankind, we see the footprints of our species' ability to significantly impact our environment, as evident with the global disappearance of megafauna following over-hunting by early humans (Schrag, 2012). This impact only grew with the invention of agriculture and the later, the Industrial Revolution. We are currently facing a great challenge to ensure the preservation of life on planet Earth as we know it. To accomplish this monumental task, the questions we need to ask in context to the prompt are: How dependent are humans on microbial engines for biogeochemical cycling and environmental transformations? How will microbes respond to these changes and can they fix the problems we have caused? Can us humans prevent the impending catastrophic changes to our planet with our technology alone, or will we need the aid of microbial systems? In this discussion, I will attempt to answer these questions and contemplate our place in the grand scheme of the global ecosystem.

####Microbial Engines in Global Elemental Recycling

In the current biosphere, us humans, and indeed all living organisms, depend on the intricate biogeochemical networks and cycling mediated by microbial communities. As stated by Falkowski et al (2008), the geophysical processes and acid-base chemistry that shaped the abiotic world created niches in which microbes quickly filled, evolving to catalyze the redox reactions that molded the elemental cycles that exist today. Without these microbial systems, it is unlikely that life on Earth, including that of humans, will persist. We will focus on the carbon and the nitrogen cycle to illustrate this point. 

Carbon is an essential element, making up the structures that form the critical molecules of life, including plasma membrane lipids, the sugars in nucleic acids and the backbone structures of amino acids used to make proteins. The most influential role of microbes in the carbon cycle is their fixation of CO2 via photosynthesis. Net primary production of phytoplankton is approximately 50% of the global number, with the remaining 50% achieved by land plants (Longhurst et al, 1995), indicating that microbes are an integral component of the carbon cycle. This also has major implications on the influx of energy into the food web, as heterotrophic microbes and higher eukaryotes depend on his autotrophic transformation of light energy into chemical energy. Also, many organisms directly rely on our oxygen-rich atmosphere for the catabolism of dietary molecules. Besides the explosion of oxygenic photosynthesis by cyanobacteria at around 2.7 Gyr that created the current atmospheric makeup, we also have microbes to thank for the maintenance of the atmospheric oxygen concentration. The marine autotroph Prochlorococcus is likely to be the most abundant genus in the biosphere and accounts for between 13-48% of the global oxygen production (Johnson et al, 2006). Another 30-60% of the global oxygen is produced by single-celled marine algae. Hence we humans, as organisms dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and therefore, oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration, are at the mercy of microbial carbon fixation and oxygen production through photosynthesis.

Nitrogen is another essential component of life and is a key element in amino acids and nucleic acid bases. As nitrogen gas is inherently inert, catalytically breaking the triple bond between the two N atoms requires a large activation energy barrier to be overcome (Canfield et al, 2010). The nitrogenase enzyme has evolved for exactly that task and quickly spread via horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes and archaea. Almost all biotic N-fixation into ammonium (NH4+) is dependent on bacteria and archaea in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. This constitutes to around 55% of the total N-fixation, with the remaining nitrogen being fixed by anthropogenic processes such as the Haber-Bosch process and in legume farming. While some eukaryotes can fix nitrogen (and it is only because of symbiotic nitrogenase-expressing bacteria!), this quantity is negligible compared to the aforementioned amount. Further along in the cycle, various bacteria oxidize ammonium into nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) to be used as terminal electron acceptors in respiration. Plants are heavily dependent on these species for their source of nitrogen. On the other end of the cycle, fixed nitrogen must return to the atmosphere as N2 gas. This is accomplished by denitrification and anammox reactions. Anoxic denitrification is highly conserved and is the bacteria and archaea and can also be found in some protozoa and fungi. By contrast, we humans contribute essentially nothing to the return of nitrogen to the atmosphere! We will return to the N-cycle in the final section of this paper, where human implications will be discussed.

####Microbial Resilience

Rough estimates place the grand total of all prokaryotes at 3.8x1030 cells (Whitman, Coleman, Wiebe, 1998). Although there are limitations to the estimation techniques and, with that, a mild degree of error, this number is staggering. The total carbon in prokaryotes can be estimated with more accuracy. At a total of 350-550x1015g of carbon, prokaryotes make up a massive reservoir of organic carbon, between 60-100% of the total plant carbon content (Whitman, Coleman, Wiebe, 1998). Even more impressive is that soil prokaryotes contain cumulatively more nitrogen than all land plants (Whitman, Coleman, Wiebe, 1998). This, once again, asserts the importance of prokaryotes as a nutrient reservoir. In the context of microbial resilience, the sheer microbial abundance in the biosphere is an indicator of stability and persistence. With this huge number of rapidly dividing cells, comes an immense net mutation rate. Whitman, Coleman and Wiebe (1998) speculated that four simultaneous mutations in every gene shared by the marine heterotroph, marine autotroph, soil prokaryote and prokaryotes in domesticated animal populations will occur between every 24 minutes to 170 hours. Thus, with such a high simultaneous mutation rate, genetic diversity within microbial conditions allows for rapid speciation and diversification of metabolic, signaling and stress response pathways. One potent example of this is in antibiotic resistance. Currently, pathogenic bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics faster than we can discover new, effective ones. In a hospital setting, this can occur within days, indicating the impressive adaptability of microbes through rapid division and spontaneous mutation. 

Not only are prokaryotes experts in environmental adaptation, they also share their abilities with other microorganisms. Horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the vast diversification of metabolic functions across all taxonomic levels. Despite these functions being incredibly widespread and divergent, with some even forming highly niche specific "boutique genes", the "core genes" remain conserved (Falkowski et al, 2008). This can be observed throughout various microbial communities in different environments, where the "core" gene set is always represented by several populations within the community. Unsurprisingly, Falkowski et al (2008) dubbed microbes as the "Guardians of Metabolism". Overall, regardless of the apocalyptic environmental or climate changes that might occur in the future, selective pressures will drive microbes to evolve and distribute new metabolic functions to survive and possibly thrive in a new Earth.

It is clear that microbes will be able to survive just fine without humans, as they have been doing for the most of Earth's geological history. To summarize Nisbet and Sleep's 2001 Nature review in a nutshell, with the creation of new substrates and habitats, ecological niches are formed in which bacteria will inhabit to utilize those substrates. This occurred with the earliest ancestral microorganisms that used sulphate around hydrothermal vents, and later on, with the evolution and explosion of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, aerobic heterotrophs evolved oxidative phosphorylation to catabolize organic carbon sources. We even see this with anthropogenic-produced molecules. Recently, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-degrading Rhodococcus samples have been cultured and characterized (Leigh et al, 2006). PCBs are a recalcitrant, toxic industrial pollutant that cannot be degraded or removed by conventional means. Another example of microbial resourcefulness is the increase in lignin-degrading bacterial populations downstream of paper production factories. The sheer metabolic resilience and versatility of microorganisms cannot be overstated.

####Humanity's Dependence on and Manipulation of Microbial Systems

With the two examples just mentioned in the previous section, we begin to see how us humans may become dependent on microbes for, not only their geochemical cycling, but also their potential as agents for bioremediation. Our industries and transportation systems are responsible for a titanic amount of CO2 and N2O influx into the atmosphere. We also disrupt biogeochemical cycles by increasing plastic, aluminium, black carbon and concrete burial in global sediments (Mooney, 2016). There is no denial that the carbon cycle has already been thrown out of balance. Current atmospheric CO2 levels are at a record 387 ppm, approaching the boundary limit for irreversible loss of the polar ice caps and severe climate change (Rockstrom et al, 2009). We must engineer a system capable of trapping or fixing CO2 and given the innate capacity for marine autotrophs to fix carbon, it is not far-fetched that such a system will utilize microbes for this purpose. We are also drastically increasing the influx of nitrogen to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. With ever-rising demand for food crops we have increased our nitrogen fertilizer usage by ~800% since the 1960s (Canfield et al, 2010), yet around 60% of this fertilizer is leached away and rained into waterways and oceans, causing massed eutrophication. Interestingly, microbial-mediated denitrification, particularly in anoxic marine habitats has risen sharply and has, for the most part, balanced the anthropogenic nitrogen influx (Canfield et al, 2010). However the capacity of this system is uncertain. Plausible solutions include optimizing fertilizer usage and engineering endosymbiosis of N-fixing bacteria into crops to decrease the need for fertilizers. Hence, with our current levels of CO2 production and nitrogen usage, humans cannot possible continue into the future without the buffering effect of microbial catalyzed biogeochemical cycling of essential elements. Even more likely, is that we have to learn to manipulate these functions in order to maintain our way of life and the preservation of the Earth (Mooney, 2016). 

####Conclusion

In this paper, I have discussed the essential microbial component in biogeochemical cycling of life-sustaining elements including the carbon and nitrogen cycles. I identified that microbial communities, with their high propensity for simultaneous mutations and horizontal gene transfer, as well as sheer abundance, confer a great degree of environmental and metabolic resilience. Lastly, I highlighted the significance of microbial-mediated environmental transformations and metabolic functions in the cushioning of humanity's detrimental effects on the environment and climate. It is for these reasons that I agree with the statement: "Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformations it provides." In the current state of affairs, we are pushing the planetary boundaries as described by Rockstrom et al (2009) and should we fail to limit our destructive behaviors, it is probable that the Earth will experience severe climate and environmental transformations, along with drastic alterations in existing biogeochemical cycles. The prospect of understanding the global microbial metabolic metagenome and engineering specific functions to suit the planet's needs is an arduous one, possibly involving Petabytes upon Petabytes of metagenomic sequencing data and analysis, not to mention the application and genetic engineering steps. We are headed into the first ever, anthropogenically-engineered eon and it will be our knowledge and manipulation of global microbial functions that lead us to either to human extinction or a lasting, prosperous worldwide symbiosis.

## Evidence worksheet_04 "Bacterial Rhodopsin Gene Expression"

###Learning objectives: 

.	Discuss the relationship between microbial community structure and metabolic diversity

.	Evaluate common methods for studying the diversity of microbial communities

.	Recognize basic design elements in metagenomic workflows

### General Questions:

#### What were the main questions being asked?

1. What are the main structural and functional features of photorhodopsin expressed in E. coli?

2. How can HGT effect the acquisition of photorhodopsin expression genes and metabolic capabilities?

3. What can be concluded about the functional diversity and ubiquity of photorhodopsin?

#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

A marine picoplankton large-insert Fosmid genomic library was surveyed for in vivo expression of PR photorhodopsin systems and following phenotypic analysis, genetic and biochemical analyses were ued to confirm the gene functions. 
 
#### Summarize the main results or findings. 

Two clones were found to possess in vivo PR photosystem gene clusters on fosmids. These photosystems have loght-dependent proton translocation activity and could strongly induce retinal biosynthesis in E. coli, driven by photophosphorylation. These genes are also capable of being transferred via HGT.
 
#### Do new questions arise from the results?

1. How are PR photosystem expression induced? Are they expressed during times of nutritional starvation and low ATP production?

2. How often do HGT events of PR photosystems occur in nature and just how widespread is the distribution and variation of these genes?

#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

The background information was sufficient and the methods explained adequately. However, the authors quantify growth based on the increase of ATP, and they assume that this ATP is used for biosynthetic purposes under their lab conditions, which may not be reflected in nature. In these lab conditions, the evidence supports the conclusions made, however whether these results are representative of the case in more dynamic environments such as in nature, is unclear.

##Evidence Worksheet_05

###Part 1: Learning objectives: 

.	Evaluate the concept of microbial species based on environmental surveys and cultivation studies.

.	Explain the relationship between microdiversity, genomic diversity and metabolic potential

.	Comment on the forces mediating divergence and cohesion in natural microbial communities

###General Questions:

####What were the main questions being asked?

1. Between 3 different strains of E. coli (2 uropathogenic, 1 non-pathogenic), what degree of genetic similarity/OTU similarity can be observed?

2. What degree of conservation of pathogenicity associated genes/PAIs exists between the strains?

3. How lateral gene transfer contributes to the emergence of new uropathogenic E. coli strains?

####What were the primary methodological approaches used?

Clones and sequencing methods:

Used pBluescript and M13Janus to prepare whole-genome libraries with genomic DNA. Data was collected from Applied Biosystem ABI377 and 3700n automated seqeuncers.SEQMANII was used to assemble sequence data and primer walking and PCR-based analysis used to finish sequencing opposite ends of linking clones. A XhoI optical map of whole genome was used to order contigs and confirm contig structure, and acts as map of whole genomes.

Sequence analysis and annotation methods:

The genome sequence was annotated in MAGPIE and defined the ORFs in GLIMMER. Protein BLAST was used to search for predicted proteins and shotgun sequencing and PCR were performed. A 90% identity match of CFT073 in either MG1655 or EDL933, 90% of both genes in alignments, and lack of equivalent match in other location in CFT073 genome used to infer orthology.

####Summarize the main results or findings. 

The CFT073 genome is a circular, 5 million-bp chromosomal sequence with seven times coverage. Selective pressure was found to result in increased conservation of PAIs in infection and host colonization. The backbone sequence is evolutionarily conserved through vertical gene transfer and remains relatively constant. Specific regions for insertion of infectious genes are conserved, however only the locations are conserved, but not the specificity of the genes. There is great genetic diversity between PAIs of pathogenic versus pathogenic strains and also of pathogenic versus non-pathogenic strains. Each strain of E. coli possesses combinations of island genes that confers its characteristic lifestyle and associated level of pathogenicity. The uropathogenic strain CFT073, for example, acquired an  island gene that allows it to infect the urinary tract and bloodstream without compromising its ability to colonize the intestine. The net result is the formation of a mosaic genome structure where newly acquired genes are inserted into the backbone framework sequence. This allows for E. coli to be distinguished from its close relatives such as Salmonella enterica.

####Do new questions arise from the results?

1. How similar/different are pathogenic E. coli strains from other pathogens such as Shigella and Y. pestis?

2. How can species be defined to account for frequent gain and loss of accessory genes as we cannot simply define species by phenotypic analysis and low resolution mapping alone.

3. Why hasn't there been any evidence of extensive genome reductions despite the fact that E.coli has been living as a commensal in the nutrient-rich intestinal system of animals for millenia? 

####Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

The overall results, figures and conclusions of the paper were clear, however some of the extraneous details in the paper assumed that the reader had a good knowledge of E.coli genomics and prior understanding of genetics. More background information on E. coli pathogenic strains and genomes is needed, as well as some explanation of genetics jargon. 
 
###Part 2: Learning objectives: 

.	Comment on the creative tension between gene loss, duplication and acquisition as it relates to microbial genome evolution

.	Identify common molecular signatures used to infer genomic identity and cohesion

.	Differentiate between mobile elements and different modes of gene transfer

####Based on your reading and discussion notes, explain the meaning and content of the following figure derived from the comparative genomic analysis of three E. coli genomes by Welch et al. Remember that CFT073 is a uropathogenic strain and that EDL933 is an enterohemorrhagic strain. Explain how this study relates to your understanding of ecotype diversity. Provide a definition of ecotype in the context of the human body. Explain why certain subsets of genes in CFT073 provide adaptive traits under your ecological model and speculate on their mode of vertical descent or gene transfer.

An ecotype in the context of the human body is defined as subtle genetic and phenotypic differences between the populations that inhabit a specific tissue environment The great variation between different tissue types in the human body results in many ecotypes. The differences are characterized by the presence of different receptors and secreted factors that comprise the extracellilar matrix of each tissue. Thus, with different tissues, comes a range of different factors that affect the ability of microbes to colonize them. Each specific tissue environment creates a niche that allows only some organisms to survive there. Parallel to this, pathogenic microbes possess a set of genes that allow them to infect only a specific type of tissue, as seen with the strains mentiones in the paper. These adaptive traits result in increased fitness, thus encouraging their persistence through vertical descent, however it is likely that new, non-pathogenic strains could acquire these genes through HGT and become able to infect the tissue type. The figure shows that between pathogenic strains, many pathogenicity-associated genes are located in the same loci while maintaining a common backbone sequence. It is likely that these genes in the same locus were derived from a common ancestral gene.

##Problem Set_04

###Learning objectives:

Gain experience estimating diversity within a hypothetical microbial community

####Part 1: Description and enumeration

Obtain a collection of "microbial" cells from "seawater". The cells were concentrated from different depth intervals by a marine microbiologist travelling along the Line-P transect in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean off the coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia.

Sort out and identify different microbial "species" based on shared properties or traits. Record your data in this Rmarkdown using the example data as a guide.

Once you have defined your binning criteria, separate the cells using the sampling bags provided. These operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be considered separate "species". This problem set is based on content available at What is Biodiversity.

For example, load in the packages you will use.

```{r}
#To make tables
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
#To manipulate and plot data
library(tidyverse)
```

Then load in the data. You should use a similar format to record your community data.

```{r}
example_data1 = data.frame(
  number = c(1,2,3),
  name = c("lion", "tiger", "bear"),
  characteristics = c("brown cat", "striped cat", "not a cat"),
  occurences = c(2, 4, 1)
)
```

Finally, use these data to create a table.

```{r}
example_data1 %>% 
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10, full_width = F)
```

For your sample:

* Construct a table listing each species, its distinguishing characteristics, the name you have given it, and the number of occurrences of the species in the collection.
* Ask yourself if your collection of microbial cells from seawater represents the actual diversity of microorganisms inhabiting waters along the Line-P transect. Were the majority of different species sampled or were many missed?

```{r}
Community_total1 = data.frame(
  number = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20),
  name = c("kiss", "red short string", "red long string", "white spiral", "mike ike", "watermelon", "gummy bear", "marshmallow bear", "lego square", "lego rectangle", "coke", "spider", "big round candy", "skittle", "m&m", "fish", "elongated noodle", "elongated cloud", "elongated oval", "elongated diamond"),
  characteristics = c("teardrop shape", "short string", "long string", "large ellipsoid flat", "rounded rod", "rectangular", "clear bear shape", "opaque bear shape", "large square brick", "small rectangular brick", "coke bottle shape", "spider shape", "sphere", "ellipsoid round", "small elipsoid flat", "fish shape", "short noodle shape", "cloud shape", "oval", "diamond"),
  occurences = c(16,6,10,3,172,1,99,3,3,15,3,6,24,187,243,1,4,3,1,1)
)

Community_total1 %>%
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10, full_width = F)

#Many species were missed in the sameple and thus does not represent the true diversity of the community. This is due to the fact that many species were low in abundance and not picked up in the sample. 
```

###Part 2: Collector's Curve

Part 2: Collector's curve
To help answer the questions raised in Part 1, you will conduct a simple but informative analysis that is a standard practice in biodiversity surveys. This analysis involves constructing a collector's curve that plots the cumulative number of species observed along the y-axis and the cumulative number of individuals classified along the x-axis. This curve is an increasing function with a slope that will decrease as more individuals are classified and as fewer species remain to be identified. If sampling stops while the curve is still rapidly increasing then this indicates that sampling is incomplete and many species remain undetected. Alternatively, if the slope of the curve reaches zero (flattens out), sampling is likely more than adequate.

To construct the curve for your samples, choose a cell within the collection at random. This will be your first data point, such that X = 1 and Y = 1. Next, move consistently in any direction to a new cell and record whether it is different from the first. In this step X = 2, but Y may remain 1 or change to 2 if the individual represents a new species. Repeat this process until you have proceeded through all cells in your collection.

For example, we load in these data.

```{r}

* Create a collector's curve.
* Does the curve flatten out? If so, after how many individual cells have been collected?
* What can you conclude from the shape of your collector's curve as to your depth of sampling?


```{r}
Community_sample1 = data.frame(
  x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20),
  y = c(0,2,6,7,41,41,57,57,57,62,62,64,70,110,164,164,164,164,165,165)

```

```{r}
ggplot(Community_sample1, aes(x=x, y=y)) +

#The curve begins to flatten at 8 species and once again at 18 species, the total number of individuals collected is 165.
#Species diversity increases in the sample at the beginning, middle and end of the curve. However, in the intermediary regions, the steepness indicates fewer new species counted.

###Part 3: Diversity estimates (alpha diversity)

Using the table from Part 1, calculate species diversity using the following indices or metrics.

####Diversity: Simpson Reciprocal Index
$\frac{1}{D}$ where $D = \sum p_i^2$

$p_i$ = the fractional abundance of the $i^{th}$ species

For example, using the example data 1 with 3 species with 2, 4, and 1 individuals each, D =

species1 = 2/(2+4+1)  species2 = 4/(2+4+1)  species3 = 1/(2+4+1)

1 / (species1^2 + species2^2 + species3^2)

Kiss = 5/147  Red_candy = 1/147  Red_long_candy = 1/147  Mike_ike = 34/147  Gummy_bear = 18/147  Lego_square = 1/147  Lego = 2/147  Spider = 1/147  Big_round = 3/147  Skittle = 31/147  MM = 48/147  Fish = 1/147  cloud = 1/147

Simpsons = 1/ (Kiss^2 + Red_candy^2 + Red_long_candy^2 + Mike_ike^2 + Gummy_bear^2 + Lego_square^2 + Lego^2 + Spider^2 + Big_round^2 + Skittle^2 + MM^2 + Fish^2 + cloud^2)

The higher the value is, the greater the diversity. The maximum value is the number of species in the sample, which occurs when all species contain an equal number of individuals. Because the index reflects the number of species present (richness) and the relative proportions of each species with a community (evenness), this metric is a diveristy metric. Consider that a community can have the same number of species (equal richness) but manifest a skewed distribution in the proportion of each species (unequal evenness), which would result in different diveristy values.

* What is the chao1 estimate for your original total community?

####Richness: Chao1 richness estimator
Another way to calculate diversity is to estimate the number of species that are present in a sample based on the empirical data to give an upper boundary of the richness of a sample. Here, we use the Chao1 richness estimator.

$S_{chao1} = S_{obs} + \frac{a^2}{2b})$

$S_{obs}$ = total number of species observed a = species observed once b = species observed twice or more

So for our previous example community of 3 species with 2, 4, and 1 individuals each, $S_{chao1}$ =

3 + 1^2/(2*2)

Chao1 = (13 + ((6^2)/(2*7)))

###The Microbial Species Definition, an Ever-Evolving Debate

####Introduction

As famously stated by James Staley in the 3rd 1997 issue of Current Opinion in Biotechnology, if the current microbial species definition of 97% DNA sequence identity was to be used in animal classification [1], the entire order primates would be considered a single species. Obviously this is not and cannot be the case. Microbial species have always been defined differently from macroorganisms due to a variety of challenges associated with delineating new microbial species, as opposed to the methods used with macroorganisms. Although scientists have long recognized this disparity, the question remains: How do we define microbial species? This paper will explore some of the difficulties faced by geneticists and bacteriologists as they attempt to define and characterize a new microbial species and the complications caused by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), focusing on the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of metabolic pathways through time. With HGT being such a prominent mechanism of microbial evolution, this paper will also discuss the influential effects of HGT on shaping biogeochemical cycles over the course of the Earth's history. Finally, the argument will be made that, although our definition of microbial species is questionable at best, it may not be necessary for us to have a clear definition for the purpose of our study of the microbial world.

####Challenges of the Microbial Species Definition

A species, as described by the zoological species definition, are: "groups of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups" [2]. Already, this presents a problem with delineating microbial species as bacteria and archaea do not "breed" via conventional sexual means as with most macroorganisms, rather they reproduce through binary fission. The currently accepted microbial species definition is a percentage equal to or higher than 70% of DNA similarity, which corresponds to 97% sequence identity [3]. These values are determined through phenotypic analyses such as fatty acid synthesis and growth conditions, and genetic analyses such as DNA-DNA hybridization, DNA profiling and sequencing and GC content ratios [3]. This is known as the polyphasic species definition [4]. However, within these methods lies another issue. Phenotypic characterization of species requires the organisms to be culturable in the laboratory and this is often not the case, as many microbial species only grown in very specific environmental conditions, making it impossible to perform phenotypic analyses. Also, although the listed genetic methods acknowledge the frequency of HGT and gene rearrangement events between microbes, they fail to account for the variation in rate and mode of these genetic exchanges that drastically differ between different microbial evolutionary lines [3]. Collectively, these issues with defining microbial species are known as the "species concept" [5]. With the rise of 16S phylogeny, multi-gene and whole genome sequencing, phylogenetic analyses appear to be a promising new method in which to define microbial species. With the power of 16S rRNA analyses to define organism ancestry and evolutionary paths, could they be used to define microbial species to a similar level of precision? The short answer is, unfortunately, no. Recent rapid evolution in prokaryotic lineages can be observed in the primary DNA sequences and through phenotypic changes, however these changes are not strongly reflected in 16S rRNA, which is relatively stable and rarely subject to alterations [3]. Additionally, some species that have almost identical 16S rRNA sequence identity have far lower than 70% DNA-DNA hybridization [6]. Other species cannot be characterized due to their distinctive phylogenetic position and uniqueness from known microorganisms [3]. Thus, 16S rRNA analysis is a powerful method in which to determine microbial ancestry, but may not be totally adequate to define microbial species and is unlikely to replace the current DNA-DNA hybridization method. It does, however, have a usefulness in determining the level of DNA reassociation analysis needed, which is often slow and complex [3]. 

####Horizontal Gene Transfer

Given its frequency and prevalence in prokaryotes and archaea, HGT represents one of the biggest challenges in delineating species within the two domains. With antibiotic resistance, it was found that between various E. coli strains, 8-21% of genes are unique to specific strains and are often encoded on genomic islands consisting of multiple genes that confer resistance[7],[8],[9]. Therefore, although there is significant degree of genetic variation between strains, they are still considered the same "species". The essential pathogenicity island cagPAI on H. pylori was shown to have been introduced only once in evolutionary history and has been retained in the genome since, while large variation in H. pylori pathogenicity-associated genes suggest rapid gain and loss of these lesser functions [10],[11]. Just as in antibiotic resistance, HGT plays an integral role in the context of metabolic pathway evolution. Some HGT events, although rare, can  lead to the transfer of entire gene sets that confer adaptation to new environment and the development of novel metabolic mechanisms [12],[13]. Another example is the transfer of genes encoding polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) degrading enzymes through conjugation between Acidovorax spp. strains, enabling recipients to catabolically breakdown PCBs and using the compounds as part of their metabolism [14]. If a strictly aerobic prokaryote can acquire a whole gene cluster that suddenly enables it to live in an anoxic environment overnight, does this qualify it to become a new species? Due to the evolutionary timescales and macroscopic perspectives in which we use to define species it becomes difficult to provide a clear answer. Yet, it is evident that the majority of variable genes acquired through HGT are lost over time, especially if they were obtained during periods of high selective pressure and are associated with an elevated fitness cost [15]. Therefore, a large proportion of the genetic diversity gained by is transient even on the small timescale. For this reason, Achtman and Wagner (2008) conclude that genetic variation due to HGT is not sufficient grounds in which to delineate microbial species [15].

####HGT Influences on Biogeochemical Cycles

Despite the transient nature of the majority of horizontally transferred genes, there have been some functions that have been retained over the course of eons. These functions helped shape the biogeochemical cycles of the past and the present. Through HGT, novel changes in metabolic activity can occur, influencing ecological changes [16]. Historically, HGT between ancestral prokaryotic and archaic species resulted in the diversification of metabolic enzymes and was thus influential in the creation of specific ecological niches. This appears to have been encouraged by heavy nutritional selective pressures [16]. The presence of dissimilatory sulfate reductases in sulfate reduce Gram positive ??-proteobacteria and archaea show evidence for lateral propagation of sulfate respiration [17], likely resulting in the establishment of sulfur cycling in anoxic environments such as the deep ocean and hydrothermal vents. In the Hadean and Archaean eons, communal evolution through HGT was the primary mechanism in the development of early metabolic pathways [17]. This global gene pool of mobile catabolic and anabolic genes represented the main mode of evolution [17]. Later in the evolutionary timeline, we see the transfer of various nitrogenases from archaea to photosynthetic cyanobacteria along with the widespread transfer and evolution of ammonia monooxygenase homologs, all of which are essential enzymes that lead to the formulation of the modern nitrogen cycle [17]. Even the acquisition of the complex gene clusters required to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules in legumes was a direct result of rare HGT events [18]. The impact of HGT can also be seen in metal biogeochemical cycles, where high frequency HGT of PIB-type ATPases between prokaryotes in deep terrestrial subsurface sediments [19]. These ATPases are essential transporters; responsible for moving soft metal ions and essential micronutrients such as Cu2+, Zn2+ and Co2+, as well as the efflux of toxic ions such as Pb2+ and Ag+ from the cytoplasm. Microbial metal homeostasis plays a crucial role in metal ion cycling in the biosphere and the HGT of these functions appears to have occurred early in evolutionary history, even before the diversification of the genus Pseudomonas [19]. Despite our best efforts, the vast majority of microbial genetic diversity remains uncharacterized. This is, in part due to the presence of unique, isolated habitats such as the deep ocean and terrestrial sediments. The microorganisms that call these environments their home are known as the rare biosphere [20]. Because sampling from these inaccessible and often dangerous habitats is very difficult, we understand little about these exclusive environments that could potentially hold a great wealth of genetic and evolutionary information. Limited studies on these deep sea microbial sulfur respiration suggest that due to them having persisted for eons, they likely once had monumental influences in the biogeochemical cycling of the past and may still continue to have an effect on modern cycles [20]. These organisms have been shown to use hydrogen and a reverse tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to fix carbon and may have contributed to the establishment of the early carbon cycle. Evidence of HGT in low-insert libraries from samples support the model of HGT being the primary mode of evolution for early microbes, especially in hostile environments. We return to gene loss and transient horizontally transferred genes. As microorganisms become more specialized and efficient in performing specific metabolic tasks, they begin to lose genes responsible for other steps in the metabolic pathway. This creates new niches in which other microbes are more than happy to fill, creating a collective metabolism shared within entire communities, but also limiting ecological overlap between different organisms [21]. 

####Is a Fixed Definition of Microbial Species Necessary?

Throughout human history, we have attempted to differentiate and classify the other living organisms around us and to an extent, we have been largely successful. Our models, methods and conventions used to describe and delineate both microorganisms and macroorganisms have allowed us to study evolutionary history to a fairy accurate degree. Now, with the advent of phylogenetics and 16S rRNA profiling we are able to able to characterize new species to an even greater amount of precision. However, an absolute definition for microbial species has not been determined. Yet, for all the purposes of scientific knowledge and innovation, we may not need a clear definition after all. In the medical world, immunologists are already capable of determining the potential pathogenicity of bacterial and viral infectious agents by detecting minute differences in their genomes. There are already systems in place to describe different populations within a bacterial "species" such as different strains and serovars. The ability of prokaryotes to gain new metabolic and antibiotic resistant functions through HGT is well known and characterized, however whether this influences the definition of a bacterial "species" is a matter of description and less of function. Suppose that a particular strain of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium leguminosarum soil bacteria gain the ability to degrade viscous hydrocarbons through HGT. Whether this organism will be described as a new strain or delineated into an entirely new species is largely irrelevant of its functions, as regardless of its taxonomy, it is likely to be used in bioremediation of oil spills. 

####Conclusion

We acknowledge that HGT, among other challenges, can make the characterization and delineation of microbial species extremely difficult, however the ability of HGT to influence our definition of microbial species is highly context dependent. While many variable genes acquired via HGT are transient and are likely to be lost over time, as in the case of transient antibiotic resistance, other horizontally transferred genes have been retained in prokaryotic and archaic genomes and became integral components of both ancient and modern biogeochemical cycles. In the case of these long-term genetic changes, the effect of HGT on the microbial species definition is justified. Ultimately, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the purpose of characterizing new microbial species must also be accounted for. Thus, when attempting to describe a novel microbial species, through the phenotypic, genetic and phylogenetic methods used today, we should recognize that this definition is flexible and dependent on the an evolutionary timescale, especially in the context of HGT. Unless a revolutionary method of analyzing bacterial genetic material is developed, it is unlikely that there will be much divergence from the current microbial species definition.
